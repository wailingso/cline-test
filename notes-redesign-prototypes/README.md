# Notes Interface Redesign Prototypes

This project contains two interactive prototypes addressing pain points in the current notes interface used by call center agents.

## Problem Statement

Agents reported several key issues with the current notes interface:
- Difficulty following related notes and action chains
- Poor note quality making information hard to scan
- Need to track billing changes across multiple BANs
- Critical alerts (fraud, deceased, collections) not prominently displayed
- "Dirty data" from incorrect BAN/CID associations
- Complex BAN/CID hierarchy causing confusion

## Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Current Design (Evolutionary)
**File:** `enhanced-current-design.html`

Improves the existing tabbed interface while maintaining familiar workflows:

**Key Features:**
- **Priority Alert Banner**: Fraud, deceased, collections alerts prominently displayed
- **Smart BAN Organization**: Visual indicators for Home Solutions, Mobility, Cross-Account, and Misplaced notes
- **Data Quality Detection**: Automatic detection of misplaced notes with correction suggestions
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Filter by category, BAN context, or data quality issues
- **Relationship Indicators**: Visual connections between related notes
- **Keyword Highlighting**: Automatic highlighting of amounts, dates, and BAN numbers
- **Improved Scanability**: Better typography and visual hierarchy

### 2. Timeline Design (Revolutionary)
**File:** `timeline-design.html`

Completely reimagines the interface as a unified customer story:

**Key Features:**
- **Unified Timeline**: Chronological view replacing tabs
- **Smart Indicators**: Contextual badges showing note relationships and issues
- **Visual Timeline**: Timeline dots and connection lines for related notes
- **Advanced Filtering**: Billing chains, technical threads, misplaced notes
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Expandable content for detailed information
- **BAN Context Badges**: Clear visual indicators for account types
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Smart detection of relationships and corrections

## Technical Implementation

Both prototypes are built with:
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - No framework dependencies
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Interactive Features** - Functional filtering, sorting, and actions
- **Realistic Data** - Uses actual note content from screenshots
- **Frontend-Only** - No API changes required

## Files

- `index.html` - Main landing page with prototype overview
- `enhanced-current-design.html` - Evolutionary approach prototype
- `timeline-design.html` - Revolutionary approach prototype
- `README.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

These prototypes demonstrate:
1. **Feasibility** - Solutions can be implemented frontend-only
2. **User Experience** - Addresses all identified pain points
3. **Scalability** - Designs work with existing data structures
4. **Flexibility** - Both evolutionary and revolutionary approaches

Recommended implementation approach:
1. Start with Enhanced Current Design for immediate improvements
2. Gather user feedback and usage analytics
3. Consider Timeline Design for future major release
4. Implement data quality improvements in parallel
